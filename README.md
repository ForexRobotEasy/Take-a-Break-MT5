# Take a Break MT5

This code is designed to control trading operations in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It includes functions to check if there are high-impact news events, close all open trades, pause trading, enable trading during specific dates and times, and stop trading completely. 

## Functionality

### isHighImpactNewsEvent(datetime eventTime)

This function checks if a given event time falls within the high-impact news event hours, which are between 12:00 and 16:00. It returns true if the event is a high-impact news event, and false otherwise.

### closeAllTrades()

This function closes all open trades by iterating through each position and checking if it is a buy or sell position. If it is, the function closes the position.

### pauseTrading()

This function checks if the account equity, balance, or margin is low. If any of these values are below a certain threshold (equity < 1000, balance < 1000, margin < 500), it closes all open trades using the closeAllTrades() function.

### isTradingAllowed()

This function checks if it is within the specified trading hours, which are between Monday and Friday and between 00:00 and 08:00. It returns true if trading is allowed, and false otherwise.

### stopTrading()

This function closes all open trades using the closeAllTrades() function and stops the Expert Advisor.

### OnTick()

This is the main function that controls the trading operations. It first checks if there is a high-impact news event using the isHighImpactNewsEvent() function and closes all open trades before the event. It then pauses trading if necessary using the pauseTrading() function. If trading is allowed based on the specified trading hours, it executes the trading logic. Otherwise, it stops trading completely using the stopTrading() function.
